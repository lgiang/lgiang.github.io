        <h1>Welcome</h1>
	        Hello! Welcome to my page!
	      <p>Here lies a lot of help for those who need some help in math. I have some SAT math worksheets I have recreated/found so that my fellow tutees can find and see if it will help.</p>
	      <p>Other items are from previous classes I have taken and projects I have completed. Not everything I have done is here, but a good amount is.</p>
              <h2 align="center">About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a grad student attending California State University in Long Beach, CA. My area of studies is actually in mathematics, I am not doing a thesis, but my favorite areas of math are topology and algebra. Ever since I could remember I knew that I wanted to be a teacher, that changed along the way (because of my fear of being inadequate), but right now I want to teach in community college. I want to get rid of the fear that community college is not good enough, because it is good enough!</p>
              <p>Another goal of mine is to help students understand that math shouldn't and isn't scary. I know math can seem scary and foreign, but to me it is like learning a new language, keep on practicing!</p>
              <p>I have a small passion for web designing and coding, but I have a terrible habit of being lazy and sometimes being impatient. During my undergrad years I had to take a coding class and learned a bit of Java, MATLAB, and some HTML and CSS (as you can see). Currently I was self-teaching myself Python on CodeAcademy, it is a long and slow process but I do hope that my coding skills will grow.</p>
