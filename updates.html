            <p>It has been a while since I have updated this site. Originally hosted at csulb.edu, but I decided to move it to github. Currently I have been very busy with my Internship at Golden West College, Tutoring at The Tutoring Club in Cypress, and nearly finishing up with my Master's program at CSULB. I have one more semester and I hope I can pass the comprehensive exams in one fell swoop and graduate. I still want to teach at community college so I am very glad to have the experience at Golden West College to learn how to manage a classroom and whatnot with Ms. Lindsay Lewis in her Math G160 (Introduction to Statistics and Probability) class.</p>
            <p>A few more weeks!</p>
